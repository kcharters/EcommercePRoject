                   You, as the customer are responsible for all taxes and duties (including VAT) imposed by your country of residence.

We ship our products domestically and to international destinations.
We store our goods in warehouses in the USA and in Europe. 

**Please note, international shipping services do vary from country to country. Shipping internationally does mean that you may be required to pay customs and import taxes. All international customers are responsible for the customs rates within their own country. For further information, we recommend contacting your local customs office.

Catpuccino.co is not responsible for any packages held by international customs agencies. This is not catpuccino.co’s responsibility and it is out of our hands. We do want to make our customers aware of these agencies and their actions. Please check with your country’s customs office to determine their procedures and any potential charges.
